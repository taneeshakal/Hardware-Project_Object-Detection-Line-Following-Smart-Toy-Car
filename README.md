# Hardware-Project_Object-Detection-Line-Following-Smart-Toy-Car

##Project Description

Mainly this car will be able to follow a black line drawn by the child in a white paper or any white 
colour surface, with the use of two IR sensors. To make the car move, go forward, backward, left 
and right, four servo motors will be used for the four wheels. A motor driver will be used to drive 
the four motors. When the car turns left or right LEDs will work as signal lights, indicating the 
turning directions.
This toy car will also be able to detect objects in its path (on the black line), with the use of an 
ultrasonic sensor. If an object is detected on the black line, the car will be automatically stopped 
and a buzzer will ring, alerting the child to remove the object from the path. Once the object is 
removed car will start moving along the line again. 
Aside from the automatic line following and object detection function, this car will also be able to 
use as a remotely controlled car, by the mobile phone with the use of a Bluetooth module.
